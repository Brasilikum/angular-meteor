# Socially Meteor-Angular Tutorial App

The purpose of this tutorial is to start from the beginning of writing applications with Meteor and AngularJS.

The tutorial will be good for you whether you do or don't have previous knowledge in either Angular or Meteor.

We will walk you through building an Angular-Meteor app. here is the final version - [http://socially-step18.meteor.com/](http://socially-step18.meteor.com/)

You can also participate in our free angular-meteor university and do step by step exercise together with community members.
Read more about the angular-meteor university [here](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially#angular-meteor-university-).

It will show you how AngularJS makes the browser smarter, while making your application code smaller and easier.

It will also show you how powerful Meteor is, with it's powerful data synchronization and latency compensation.

We will also tap into the huge eco-systems of each of those frameworks that will allow us to write quality applications in a fraction of the time.

Our goal in this tutorial is to add more steps as we go along, to cover as many use cases as possible, so if there
is a use case you are missing here, please suggest it on our [Github issues page](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/issues).

We also welcome pull requests for new chapters, we would love to work with you on them!

Enjoy!
